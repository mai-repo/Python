# As a beginner Python learner, your task is to demonstrate that you can set up Python locally and create simple unit tests. Follow these steps:

    # Install Python on your local machine if you haven't already. Make sure you have version 3.x installed.
    # Open a text editor or IDE (like PyCharm, VSCode, or Sublime Text) and create a new Python file.
    # Write a simple Python script with at least two functions that perform different operations. For example:

def add_numbers(a, b):
  return a + b

print (add_numbers(2,3))

def multiply_numbers(a, b):
    return a * b

print (multiply_numbers(2,3))
